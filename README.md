This is a README file for Holland-Skinner Applied Behavior Analysis program
implemented by Duke Dyer as a teaching project.

It doesn't contain an actual curriculum, but it is supposed to be fully
functional single-user one-pass teaching machine similar to one designed
by Holland and Skinner.

On program launch the user is being greeted.

He is presented with his progress information.
(Options: Go to page, Quit)

On G keypress the user is redirected to the main program interface - the
frame screen.
Here he can see:
- the name of the current set
- the number of the frame and total number of frames in current set
- the contents of the page
- one or more pairs of fields:
	- for answer entry
	- for correct answer display
- prompt display field
- keyprompts:			TO DO: think about implementation
	- exit set
	- notepad			(maybe)
	- help				(maybe)
	- exhibit			TO DO: think about implementation
	- prompt
	- next frame

(The rest of potential readme is actually a belletristic now.
I may finish it if the work goes that far as to present more
information on the program.)
