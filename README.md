This is a README file for Holland-Skinner Applied Behavior Analysis program
implemented by Duke Dyer as a teaching project.

It doesn't contain an actual curriculum, but it is supposed to be fully
functional single-user one-pass teaching machine similar to one designed
by Holland and Skinner.

On program launch the user is being greeted.

He is presented with the course curriculum, with his current set marked
with an arrow.
At this point the user may quit or proceed.

After pressing "Enter" the user is redirected to the main program interface - the
frame screen.
The program prints:
- the number and name of the current set
- the number of the frame and total number of frames in current set
- the contents of the frame
Then the program asks the user to enter answers to the question 1.
The user may enter "?" to get a prompt: the first letter of the correct
answer.

- prompt display field
- keyprompts:			TO DO: think about implementation
	- exit set
	- notepad			(maybe)
	- help				(maybe)
	- exhibit			TO DO: think about implementation
	- prompt
	- next frame

(The rest of potential readme is actually a belletristic now.
I may finish it if the work goes that far as to present more
information on the program.)
